# Environment Variables

## Local Development

Copy the appropriate file to `.env.local` for local development:

```bash
# To develop against beta environment
cp .env.local.beta .env.local

# To develop against prod environment (when available)
cp .env.local.prod .env.local
```

## Deployed Environments

Amplify deployments **do not use** these files. Environment variables are injected by the AmplifyStack during deployment based on the stage (beta/prod).

See: `packages/infra/lib/amplify-stack.ts`
